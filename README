== Description
   This is a pure Ruby version of the win32ole library that ships as part
   of the Ruby standard library.

== Synopsis
   require 'pr/win32ole'

   # Your standard win32ole code here

== Notes
   The interface and semantics are identical to the win32ole library that
   ship as part of the Ruby standard library. Any code you wrote using the
   C extension should work with this library as well.

== Purpose
   The current win32ole code is difficult to maintain, decipher and debug.
   By providing a pure Ruby version, we make maintenance and debugging much
   more manageable. In addition, it is much easier to extend and modify.
   Finally, it can be updated more readily because it's an independent library.
